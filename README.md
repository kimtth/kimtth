### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ I like going through IT trends and technology. This archive is a personal space for learning and references.
- ðŸ“« If you visit here through LinkedIn, I just open to the public for the evidence that I have been experienced.  
- Especially when you want to find the repositories for only my work. 
- ``` Please click "Repositories" then filter by "Type: Sources". ```
