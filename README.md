### Hi there 👋

- 😄 I like going through IT trends and technology. This archive is a personal space for learning and references.
- 📫 If you visit here through LinkedIn, I just open to the public for the evidence that I have been experienced.  
- Especially when you want to find the repositories for only my work. 
- ``` Please click "Repositories" then filter by "Type: Sources". ``` + `software-architect-mindmap` repository
